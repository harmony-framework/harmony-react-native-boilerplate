# Generate Components

<b>Location</b>: `src/components/`

Components, not much to say, here your components `( components/ )` or in other words dump components, it means that the component is not connect to redux and relay only on props.

We recommended to use arrow function for better performance, But you can also use React Component.

## Create Component by cli

``` sh
$ gulp createComponent --name MyComponent --storyTitle Business Components/MyComponent
```
